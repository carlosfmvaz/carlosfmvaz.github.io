Hey fellas! Iâ€™m a Brazillian software engineer, passionate about building scalable, high-performance systems. I specialize in backend development, cloud architecture, and DevOps, working primarily with Node.js (TypeScript), AWS, PHP, Terraform, and caching solutions.

This blog is a space where I share knowledge (with a little bit of ChatGPT to help me organize my ideas and help me with the English ðŸ™ƒ) about software development, architecture, and cloud infrastructure. It also serves as my personal documentation hub, where I keep track of useful insights, solutions, and best practices Iâ€™ve learned along the way.

Beyond coding, I enjoy sci-fi books, music, and hitting the gym.

Feel free to explore, learn, and share! ðŸš€
